Homework 2 - Deep Learning Class

AI Platform Unified Demo Part1_Part2 

Demonstrate simple hello world examples end-2-end with automl tools on google cloud AI Platform. 

Part1

[AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs/tutorials/) with your optional but important creative modifications.
Like either use different data sets or building your own data set by labelling and collecting from images.google.com or 
something else that you think you can do (or may be even taking pictures using ur mobile phone cameras), 
different target labels, different tuning configurations s to automl etc., 
I challenge the students to take on interesting twists to these hello world examples and produce results.

Five examples - one in each of below categories. 

Hello AI Platform (Unified) 
•	Hello image data
  Use an image dataset to train an AutoML model.
  
  Result: 
  
  Successfully Trained an AutoML Image Classification Model using different dataset (smaller dataset - Citrus Plants)
  The dataset was created using import image and same as the labeling of images.
  The training took only 27mins and have low accuracy of Black Spot labeled data based on the Confusion Matrix.
  The main issue is the deployment of a model to send a prediction failed to create in endpont creation process.
  (Refer page 9~16 for the detailed demo screenshot of this report)
 
•	Hello text data
  Use a text dataset to train an AutoML model.
  
•	Hello video data
  Use a video dataset to train an AutoML model.
  
•	Hello custom training
  Learn how to bring your own code to AI Platform, by using a sample app to train an image recognition model.
  
•	Hello structured data
  Use a structured dataset to train an AutoML model.
  
  Note that you should choose very limited compute and are not expected to have state of art models - but just a model which shows loss is going in downward 
  direction.
