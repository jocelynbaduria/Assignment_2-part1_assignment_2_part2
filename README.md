Homework 2 - Deep Learning Class

AI Platform Unified Demo Part1_Part2 

Demonstrate simple hello world examples end-2-end with automl tools on google cloud AI Platform. 

Part1
[AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs/tutorials/) with your optional but important creative modifications.
Like either use different data sets or building your own data set by labelling and collecting from images.google.com or 
something else that you think you can do (or may be even taking pictures using ur mobile phone cameras), 
different target labels, different tuning configurations s to automl etc., 
I challenge the students to take on interesting twists to these hello world examples and produce results.
